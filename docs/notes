ROI (sem cupoes // dividendos):
     The first step is to list each type of asset in a spreadsheet, along with their calculated ROI, and any dividends, cash flows, management fees, and other figures relevant to the cost or returns of those assets. You'll need to know the following:

    The total cost of each investment including any fees and commissions
    The historical returns of each investment
    The portfolio weight of each investment, represented as a percentage of the portfolio's total value.
